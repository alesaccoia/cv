## Profile

I was born in Brescia the 8th of January 1982 (36 y.o.). Since my graduation in Computer 
Science in 2006 I have
worked in Italy and abroad in several institutions and digital technology start-ups.
My role has covered many aspects of data analysis: since my first job, in football 
statistics for Panini, I have then delved for a few years in the subjects related to
Digital Signal processing and analysis, Music Information Retrieval, Pattern Recognition,
and lately Machine Learning, Speech Recognition, Natural Language Processing and multi-variate 
data analysis in R, Python, SPSS, MySQL, Matlab, C++.

During this time I have been doing a mix of programming and project management, depending
on the projects; for 4 years I have been Creative Technologist and then Technical Director
at [Dinahmoe](http://www.dinahmoe.com),
an awarded Digital Production company: working in the creative fields of advertisement
has forced me to be a quick learner and have an experimental approach to ideate and offer
solutions using the latest technological advances.

I am a data enthusiast, and I am currently pursuing a second degree in Political Science
at the University of Milan: studying of subjects such as Political Science, Applied Social
Statistics, Sociology, Marketing and Macro economy I gained a fuller edge on the analysis of
human generated data.
